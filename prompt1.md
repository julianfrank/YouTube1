Build a HTML5 web page as a single HTML file that lets high school kids to test their basic math skills tested on a regular basis. 
The solution will have two different users : kid and parent. 

The user stories for each are as follows:
1. As a kid I should be able to take a timed test consisting of 10 questions that appear one after another
2. I should be able to go back to previous questions
3. The questions should consist of only the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
4. The maximum numbers under consideration should be higher than 100
5. At the end of the test I should be able to see my score and the time taken
6. The test should end if tim taken is more than 5 minutes
7. Ensure that the answers are always an integer
8. As a parent I should be able to see all the tests taken by the kid including the score, time taken and the actual question, actual answer and answer given by kid
9. Ensure that after the test is over the entire result is shown
10. There should be a header that allows to move between parent and kid screens at any time
11. cache the results in localstore
12. Ensure that in multiplication the maximum result should be less than 100 
13. In the result reports show correct answers in red and incorrect answers in green
14. For the parent give and option to clear the localstore
